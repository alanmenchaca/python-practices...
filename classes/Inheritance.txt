*** Inheritance ***
You don't always have to start from scratch when writing a class. If the class you're writing
is a specialized version of another class you wrote, you can use inheritance. Whe one class
inherits from another, it automatically takes on all the attributes and methods of the first
class. The original class is called the parent class, and the new class is the child class.
The child class inherits every attribute and method from its parent class but it also free to
define new attributes and method of its own.
